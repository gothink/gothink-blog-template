# Making Your Markdown Stand Out

So you've got the basics of Markdown down, but what if you want to add a little bit of flair to your content? In this guide, we'll cover some more advanced features that can make your content stand out.

## Bold and Italics

You can use bold and italic text to emphasize important words or phrases in your content. But did you know that you can also use strikethrough text to indicate text that is no longer relevant? To create ~~strikethrough text~~, wrap your text in double tildes, like this: `~~strikethrough text~~`.

## Lists

In addition to unordered lists, you can also create ordered lists in Markdown. To create an ordered list, simply use numbers instead of asterisks:

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

## Blockquotes

If you want to call attention to a specific quote from another source, you can use blockquotes. To create a blockquote, simply add a `>` symbol before your text. For example:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

> This is a blockquote

And there you have it! With these advanced features, you can create content that is both easy to read and visually appealing.
